            <h2>Carolina Villegas</h2>
            <p> Born in Colombia 1995, Carolina came to the US as a toddler and grew up in a tight knit family. 
                As a teenager she started thinking what the hell she was going to do with her life. The first thought was always money. 
                She needed a job that was going to provide enough money day one. 
                Nursing seemed to be the best course of action, but a missed deadline caused her to switch to Marketing and get it over with. 
                She graduated 10 days before becoming a mother; she got a job in a temp agency and was able to make it a career going from recruiter to Strategic Program Manager overseeing multiple key accounts in Atlanta, GA. 
            </p>
            <p>  
                Although she had to this point done well in her career she wasnted more. Some people she followed on instagram kept creating content about investing in stocks, real estate, cryptocurrenices and then NFTs; she became intrigued.
                She immersed herself in all of these investing avenues and took classes spending thousdands of dollars just to understand, "How"? 
                How can she make passive income that could then replace her earned income and get to the point where she can retire her mother, then father?
                It seemed so far fetched but it's not. This is what led her to create this NFT project: COVIDGOONS.
            </p> 
            <p>
                COVIDGOONS was the name and she had all the details and ideas for the art but through more research and development she realized although yes, COVIDGOONS was a great idea it didn't encompass her main purpose.
                Not only that but it left so much on the table and didn't give her future collectors a reason to invest in her NFTs. She took a step back and analyzed her 'WHY.''
                She realized there has always been one common theme in her life: helping people. Helping her parents translate everything, helping her freinds fill out their FAFSA so they can go to College, helping people create great resumes that showcase their experience, helping friends and family fill out legal documents including yearly taxes, helping friends make budgets, etc.
                Thankfully, Carolina is resourceful and if she dosen't know she will figure it out and that quality is what has allowed her to be a resource for the people in her community. 
                Through this experience she realized the lack of knowledge, the ignorance to so many important aspects of life and that is why she believes in pouring into people and sharing the wealth of knowledge with the community. 
            </p>
            <p>
                What does this have to do with anything? Well she decided to move forward with COVIDGOONS but under a parent company called Ninjeka Labs.
                Ninjeka Labs will be releasing COVIDGOONS and then using atleast 50% of the profits of this project to research and develop different projects that will focus on teaching financial literacy.
                The biggest focus will be teaching it to children through illustrated books and skits. They are the foundation of our future and Ninjeka Labs feels that they should be taught in digestible pieces many different subjects including business management, creativity outlet, entrepreneuship, budgeting, investing foundations and networking.
                They will also develop materials for teens including volunteering, networking, budgeting, college prepardness, taxes preparation, introduction to investing, resume buidling and interview prep.
                And last but not least materials for adults that will include a gentle but stearn parenting course, self care and self confidence seminars, taxes prep, resume building, investing & wealth building  and career readiness.
                This is the initial outline of what Ninjeka Labs will work on but with time this will grow into a full blown self development/self improvement series that anyone can benefit from.
            </p>
            <p>
                Carolina is passionate about helping and lives her life by the quote 'We rise by lifting others'. It is a huge gift to be able to even think of how this will come to frutition and how many lives will be improved or further developed.
